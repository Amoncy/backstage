Also known as gerrit, is an internal mirror for the product source code. Internal systems(PNC/Brew) cannot use an external git repository (like GitHub, where typically Community projects host their source code), and this is the reason why you need to ask for the creation of internal git repositories that will mirror the external one, so that the source code is in a more controlled and closed environment.
